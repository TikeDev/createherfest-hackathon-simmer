## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **Who:** People with temporary, chronic, or permanent physical or cognitive limitations (pain flares, low energy, limited dexterity, brain fog, dietary restrictions, restricted tools/techniques).
- **Problem:** Most recipes assume full dexterity, consistent energy, and zero dietary restrictions. Finding a recipe that is actually safe and doable today — not just in general — requires significant manual filtering across multiple sites.
- **Impact:** Users either cook unsafe meals (allergen exposure, techniques they can't perform), give up and skip eating, or spend energy they don't have researching alternatives. A bad recipe recommendation isn't just inconvenient — it can cause harm.

## ✨ Solution Overview

**What we built:** Simmer is a React PWA that combines a persistent accessibility profile with optional session-level input (how you're feeling *right now*) to surface recipes that are genuinely safe and doable for the user at that moment. An AI extraction agent processes recipe URLs or pasted text into a structured, offline-capable format. Recommended recipes open in a Playbook View — a simplified, step-checkable cooking mode designed for low cognitive load.

**Key Features:**

- **Persistent safety profile:** Stores allergens, excluded ingredients, dexterity/mobility limits, restricted tools/techniques, preferred appliances, cognitive load level, and sensory preferences.
- **Session-aware recommendations:** Users can describe their current state via chips (low energy, pain flare, brain fog) and/or free text to get context-sensitive results — without losing their baseline profile.
- **Hard safety filtering:** Allergens, excluded ingredients, and restricted techniques are *never* surfaced, including in ingredient alternatives.
- **Soft scoring & explainability:** Remaining recipes are ranked by time fit, energy fit, appliance fit, sensory match, and cleanup burden. Every recommendation shows "Why this fits you."
- **AI extraction agent:** Imports any recipe URL or pasted text into a structured, offline-capable format using gpt-5-nano with function calling.
- **Playbook View:** Step-checkable cooking mode with large text and minimal distraction — designed for use while cooking with limited attention.
- **Source-faithful substitutions:** Ingredient alternatives are shown only when the original recipe source provides them, and only after passing all safety constraints.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Demo Path

### Installation (1 Command)

**Requirements:** Node 18+, pnpm, OpenAI API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-repo] simmer && cd simmer && cp .env.example .env && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Add your `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`, then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

### 60-Second Demo Path

1. **Set up your profile** — Select allergens, mobility limits, and preferred appliances → Profile is saved locally.
2. **Describe today's state** — Pick chips ("low energy", "one hand") and/or type a note → App filters and scores in real time.
3. **Open a recipe in Playbook View** — Tap a recommendation → Step through the recipe with checkboxes, large text, and "Why this fits you" context.
4. **Import a recipe** — Paste a URL or recipe text → Extraction agent parses it into structured format, available offline.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Components:**

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript — PWA (via `vite-plugin-pwa`), Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 3. Handles profile setup, session input, recommendations, recipe detail, and Playbook View.
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless function (`api/fetch-recipe.ts`) — CORS proxy for recipe URL fetching. No persistent server.
- **Database:** IndexedDB via `idb` — fully local storage for recipes, user profile, and offline extraction queue.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI `gpt-5-nano` (temp 0.3) with function calling — powers the recipe extraction agent (parse ingredients, extract steps, convert units, validate output).

### 🤖 goose Integration (AI/ML Track)

- **Model:** gpt-5-nano via OpenAI SDK (run directly in-browser through a Vercel-proxied API call).
- **Implementation:** A multi-step agent loop in `src/agent/recipeAgent.ts` calls 6 structured tools — `extract_preamble`, `parse_ingredients`, `extract_steps`, `convert_volume_to_weight`, `convert_weight_to_volume`, `validate_output` — to transform unstructured recipe text into typed, validated JSON. The agent runs up to 10 iterations with a tool-call cap.
- **Impact:** Converts any recipe URL or raw text into an accessible, structured format in ~5–10 seconds — including both volume and weight unit variants for users who cook by feel or by scale.

## 🧪 Testing & Known Issues

**Test Results:** Manual testing — unit tests not yet written.

- **Known Issue:** Extraction agent reliability varies with heavily formatted recipe pages (infinite scroll sites, paywalled content). Workaround: paste recipe text directly.
- **Known Issue:** Offline queue drain (processing URL imports when connectivity returns) is not yet implemented — queued URLs remain pending until the user re-opens the app online.
- **Next Step:** Add PlaybookView, recommendation engine with hard filter + soft scoring, and the curated recipe dataset.
