# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**Simmer** — A React PWA built for the CreateHerFest Hackathon (deadline: March 7, 2026) that helps users with temporary, chronic, or permanent physical/cognitive limitations find and follow accessible recipes.

**Status:** Implementation phase — scaffold complete, building extraction agent.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript (PWA via vite-plugin-pwa)
- **Bundler:** Vite 6
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3
- **Storage:** IndexedDB via `idb`
- **AI:** OpenAI `gpt-5-nano` (temp 0.3) with function calling for recipe extraction
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Package manager:** pnpm

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install       # Install dependencies
pnpm dev           # Start dev server
pnpm build         # Production build (tsc + vite build)
pnpm preview       # Preview production build locally
pnpm lint          # ESLint
```

## Architecture

### Core User Flow

```
User profile + optional session input (chips / text / both)
        ↓
Hard filter: block allergens, excluded ingredients, restricted tools
        ↓
Soft scoring: time, energy, appliance fit, cleanup, sensory match
        ↓
Ranked recommendations with "Why this fits you" reasons
        ↓
Recipe detail → Playbook View → step-by-step cooking mode
```

Full data models, API routes, recommendation logic, and safety rules are in [docs/plans/Initial_MVP_Plan.md](docs/plans/Initial_MVP_Plan.md). Extraction agent pipeline details are in [docs/plans/PLAN-RECIPE_EXTRACTION_AGENT.md](docs/plans/PLAN-RECIPE_EXTRACTION_AGENT.md).

## Browser / DevTools

**Default browser is Chrome Beta.** Never open a new browser window or tab. See [docs/CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_ONBOARDING.md](docs/CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_ONBOARDING.md) for debugging sequences, anti-patterns, and the standard debugging order.

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (90-99% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo test          # Cargo test failures only (90%)
rtk vitest run          # Vitest failures only (99.5%)
rtk playwright test     # Playwright failures only (94%)
rtk test <cmd>          # Generic test wrapper - failures only
```

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
rtk git status          # Compact status
rtk git log             # Compact log (works with all git flags)
rtk git diff            # Compact diff (80%)
rtk git show            # Compact show (80%)
rtk git add             # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git commit          # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git push            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git pull            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git branch          # Compact branch list
rtk git fetch           # Compact fetch
